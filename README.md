# Hospitality Revenue Management Dashboard
# Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, has been facing challenges in maintaining its market share and revenue due to rising competition and ineffective decision-making. To overcome this, the company decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence for better revenue management.
