Hospitality Revenue Management Dashboard
Project Overview
This project aims to help AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain, regain its market share and optimize revenue strategies through data-driven decision-making. Due to rising competition and ineffective revenue management, the company sought external data analytics expertise to extract insights from historical data.

To address this, I built a Power BI dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs), revenue trends, and competitor benchmarking. The solution involved data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization to empower the revenue management team with actionable insights.

Key Deliverables
 Data Cleaning & Modeling: Processed raw data using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency.
 Data Transformation: Utilized DAX to calculate custom metrics and business logic.
 Interactive Dashboard: Designed a Power BI dashboard based on stakeholder requirements.
 Actionable Insights: Provided additional insights beyond the initial metric list and mock-up.
